if num%2==0:

    print("num is even")

else:

    print("Num is odd")

Output:
-------
Enter a number:6

num is even



(iii)Write a python program to read a number and display the respective value in the word format?

if num==0:

    print("Zero")

elif num==1:

    print("One")

elif num==2:

    print("Two")

elif num==3:

    print("Three")

elif num==4:

    print("Four")

elif num==5:

    print("Five")

else:

    print("Number is out of range")

Output:
------
Enter a number:4

Four



(iv)Write a python program to check whether the given number is in between 1 to 100 using
    if else statement?

Program:
-------
num=int(input("Enter a number:"))

if num>=1 and num<=100:

    print("The number",num,"in between number")

else:

    print("The number",num,"not in between number")

Output:
-------
Enter a number:102

The number 102 not in between number

(v)Write a python program  using while loop to display first N numbers divisible by 5?

Program:
-------
N=int(input("Enter the value of N:"))

count=0

num=5

while count<N:

    print(num)

    num+=5

    count+=1

Output:
-------
Enter the value of N:4

5

10

15

20

(vi)Write a python program to accept some list elements and find sum of elements?

Program:
--------
mylist=input("Enter a list of numbers separated by space:")

mylist=list(map(int,mylist.split()))

sum=0

for num in mylist:

    sum+=num

    print("The sum of the numbers is:",sum)

Output:
-------
Enter a list of numbers separated by space:10 20 30 40 50

The sum of the numbers is: 10

The sum of the numbers is: 30

The sum of the numbers is: 60

The sum of the numbers is: 100
The sum of the numbers is: 150

(vii)Write a python program to print numbers from 1 to 10 skipping at 5 and breaking at 8?
Program:
--------
for x in range(1,10):

    if x==5:

        continue

    if x==8:

        break

    print(x)

Output:
------
1
2
3
4
6
7

(viii)Write a python program to print even numbers between 0 to 20 only using while loop?

Program:
--------
n=0

while n<=20:

    print(n)

    n+=2

Output:
------
